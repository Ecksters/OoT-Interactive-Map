# OoT-Interactive-Map
Interactive Map for the world of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

Check out our goals for the project on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/DSrWWi3Z/ocarina-of-time-interactive-map).

Web application is read-only, no server-side logic required.

Due to sheer size of the split OoT maps, to install the images, [download the zip file of the maps](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1zZPhx5b2i1X05PQzV0YU1EVkU) and extract it into a "maps" subfolder located in the same folder as the index.html file.

This project is being worked on heavily, but you can view a recently uploaded version here:

Built using [LeafletJS](leafletjs.com).
