# Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Interactive Map
Interactive Map for the world of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

I am no longer maintaining this project outside of necessary changes to keep it working.

Check out the historical goals for the project on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/DSrWWi3Z/ocarina-of-time-interactive-map).

Web application is read-only, no server-side logic required.

Due to sheer size of the split OoT maps, to install the images, [download the zip file of the maps](https://www.mediafire.com/file/c2k3mkvxqby54lz/maps.7z/file) and extract it into a "maps" subfolder located in the same folder as the index.html file.

You can view a live uploaded version here:
http://OoTMap.com/

Should that domain name ever go down, the map is also hosted via Github from this repository:
https://ecksters.github.io/OoT-Interactive-Map/

Built using [LeafletJS](http://leafletjs.com).
